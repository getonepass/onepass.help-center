## Find funding

Some funding opportunities and some of the most popular tags are already featured for you in the homepage of the OnePass Hub, but there are many more opportunities that might interest you.
You can use the search feature to filter them and identify those that fit best to your needs.

### Which are the search criteria?

There are different search options that can help you find funding opportunities that might fit your interests:

- **Text** to retrieve opportunities that include that word(s) in their name.

- Funding **type**: filter the opportunities by the nature of the funding they offer:
  - Public / Equity-free funding: under this category you will find "cascade funding" (aka Financial Support for Third Parties -FSTP-). This is the funding opportunities that granted projects by the EC offer to third parties to support innovation, uptake of new technologies, develop pilots or experiments, etc.
  - Acceleration / Incubation programmes: here you will find traditional acceleration programmes (those which may take some equity in exchange for acceleration) and incubation services (those which offer knowledge or services to support the creation of new ventures) that are sponsored or managed by public bodies.
  - Other opportunities: these are referring to opportunities that may not offer funding but are related to them, e.g., open calls to select early adopters willing to uptake funded technology development, calls for expression of interest to support funded projects with innovation services, calls for experts, etc.
  - Private funds: under this category you may find initiatives promoted by private entities, including those from corporates, technology funds, etc.

- **Status**: select opportunities as per their application submission period:
  - Open for applications: these are opportunities whose application period is active (i.e., those can still be applied for).
  - Coming soon: this is forthcoming opportunities (those which have not launched yet, but will do it soon).
  - Closed: application period is over. It’s a log of past opportunities that can help you understand, e.g., which other topics or projects were funded before to understand the state-of-the-art.
  - Always open: this is used for opportunities that will be active for a long period (e.g., as long as the programme sponsoring them is active) and/or will be assessed and granted on a "first come, first served" basis.

- **Beneficiary** type and size: use these criteria to find opportunities that a specific type of organization can apply for. The possibilities are:
  - Individuals, for natural persons, be it an expert, an ambassador, a researcher or an entrepreneur.
  - Self-employed and Sole proprietorships, is referring to those one-person companies, which are carrying out business activity but might not be registered as a company and might not have employees.
  - Private companies, this means all privately held companies of any size, as soon as they are registered as a legal entity.
  - Non-profit organizations, including associations, federations, civil society organizations… any whose activity is not oriented to obtaining economic benefits.
  - Research and technology organizations are private or public research centres or technology transfer/promotion organizations, in any thematic subdomain.
  - Academia, this is particularly addressing universities, colleges and any other secondary or tertiary higher learning institution for the teaching, studying, and scientific work.
  - Public Company is used for organizations which are partially or totally sustained by public funds.
  - Government agency refers to public bodies which are part of a national, regional or local government. Examples of these could be: a regional development agency or a public organization for the promotion of a given technology.
  - Consortia is group of companies that apply together to a scheme. This is not a legal person and, hence, is usually represented by a coordinator
  - Partnerships are legal arrangements that allows two or more organizations to share responsibility for a project or business.
  - Other.

  A *note: in those cases of compounded entities (e.g., consortia or partnerships), the requirements related to their composition (if any) to apply for a particular opportunity will be detailed in the opportunity description*.
  The size criteria can be used to filter the applicants targeted by the opportunity in case they include restrictions with this regard (e.g. those targeted to SMEs, midcaps, etc.)

- **Industries** and **technologies**: you can use these to identify those opportunities which are targeting a specific sector (i.e. activity area or subarea) or promoting the use of a specific technology. They are tag-based criteria: this means, you can select one or more from the list shown or you can start typing (in English!) to get suggestions of the closest existing tags to the word you want to use.

### Creating a search

You can use these criteria individually or combine them in a search:

- Navigate to the "[Find funding](https://getonepass.eu/search/opportunities)" section in the homepage.
- In the text box, type a text string (a part of a word, a complete word or a group of them) to retrieve the opportunities that contain those characters in its name or tagline and / or,
- Simply click on the check box of the categories that you want to select, for the rest of the filters.

On the right of each category, you can find the number of opportunities linked to it. This number will be dynamically adapting to the combination of criteria as you search.

You can remove a tag from your combination by unmarking the category in the corresponding list of filters or by clicking the cross in the tag at the begining of the list. On the contrary, if you want to remove a text string, you will need to delete it manually. It is also possible to remove all your search criteria in one click: simply click the reset filters button on the right just above the first result of the list.

### Setting up notifications

If you found the right mix of search criteria to get the list of opportunities that best fit your interest, you can create an alert. [Find out how](./alerts.md)

You will see the number of opportunities retrieved just above the list and you can sort them by relevance, opening date or deadline by selecting one of those options in the drop-down box above the first result of the list.

- "Activities" will help you filter the training depending of the type of activities that a course includes (e.g. webinar, workshop, trainer-led course, practice coursework, simulation...)

- the name of the training,
