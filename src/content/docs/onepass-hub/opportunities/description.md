## Funding opportunities description

The description of the opportunities is a summary intended to provide simplified key information which could help you decide if it fits your interests or not. However, if you decide to apply, we strongly recommend to read the full information package.

This summaries will include similar information in all cases, but there might be slight differences between those opportunities that can be applied through OnePass and those which are simply for your information.


### Oportunities managed through OnePass
This description of the opportunities managed in OnePass, includes:

In the header, 
-   the logo of the EU-funded project sourcing the funding,
-   the name of the opportunity and a short tagline to give you a hint of its purpose,
-   the industry and technology tags promoted by the opportunity (if any) 
-   the disclaimer about the opportunity manager ("This opportunity is managed by FundingBox") and 
-   a flag indicating that it's open for applications (if the case).

Next, in the key information bar, 
-   a disclaimer indicating that you can apply with OnePass ("Apply with OnePass Available")
-   the deadline for application submission and
-   the type of funding offered.

Finally, the summary will brief the main features of the opportunity (e.g. activities that the opportunity aims to finance, the funding that might be granted to each beneficiary, other restrictions applicable) and will provide some context. Additionally, the opportunities include a set of guidance and support documents, including full information for those who might be interested in applying.

A floating box that will be shown at all times, includes the "Apply now" button to start an application, along with a reminder of the deadline for the submission of the application and a button to suscribe for updates, so that you can be informed if there is any changes in the opportunity. 

### Other funding opportunities

For the opportunities that are managed through different platforms, the information that you will find in the summary includes:

In the header, you will find the same information as in the opportunities managed through OnePass except for the disclaimer and the status flag.

Right below, in the key information bar, 
-   the status regarding application period, (i.e. coming soon, open, closed...)
-   the deadline before which an application must be submitted, and
-   the number of countries in which applicants might be established to be eligible.

After that, the summary includes 4 main sections:
-   "About this opportunity", providing some context related to the objectives of the programme or project sourcing the money and the purpose of the funding scheme.
-   "Eligible applicants" offers a description of the requirements for the targeted applicants.
-   "Supported actions" which explains which activities will be funded (and related requirements, if any), the maximum amount of funding (and/or any other benefits) and the expected duration of the participation, and
-   "Other information" with any other details impacting the results of the call or related to the overall programme or project.

Below the summary, you can also find the profiling of beneficiaries, with the categories selected for the type and size of the beneficiaries.

And, finally, in the floating box in the right side, you will find links to the application site and the information source, jointly with a reminder of the deadline.
